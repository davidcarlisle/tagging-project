# Screen Reading Examples (DRAFT)


The "Larger Example" on the [WTPDF from LaTeX page](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/documentation/wtpdf-from-latex#a-larger-example)
shows a small typical LaTeX article set in two columns with tables and figures.

Here we show the effect of tagging on generated speech. All examples
use the test release of NVDA 2025 (enabling interfacing to MathML
readings), along with public versions of MathCat,  Foxit and 
Acrobat Reader on Windows 11.

To present something of the experience to users not familiar with screen
readers, we have provided video clips of readings of the full document
and of specific sections. Although a video format is used they are all
recordings of the screen reader, with a fixed video frame showing the
part the document in each case.
