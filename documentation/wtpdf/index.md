# Generating Well-Tagged PDF from LaTeX Examples


Examples demonstrating generating Well-Tagged PDF from LaTeX.

Firstly a small example is provided.

A more realistic example showing various structures common in STEM publications
is provded in the second page.

The later pages go in to detail on the effect of various options, all using
this second example document.

All examples use the test release of NVDA 2025 (enabling interfacing
to MathML readings), along with public versions of MathCat, Foxit and
Acrobat Reader on Windows 11.

To present something of the experience to users not familiar with screen
readers, we have provided video clips of readings of the full document
and of specific sections. Although a video format is used they are all
recordings of the screen reader, with a fixed video frame showing the
part the document in each case.
